ps2img - Create, inspect or extract Playstation 2 ROM image files
Copyright (c) 2005 Damien Ciabrini (dciabrin), Olivier Parra (yo6)

    -------------------------------------------------------------   

This program enables the inspection of PS2 ROM image files, the
so-called *.IMG files. An IMG file is a simple archive containing a
set of IOP IRX modules that are intended to be updated version of 
some of the drivers located in your PS2 BIOS. When the IOP is reset,
the IRXs present in this image will be used instead of the original
ones present in the BIOS.

With ps2img you can create your own IMG files, or modifying existing
IMG files (ie deleting or adding IRXs from/to the archive).


Just type "make" to compile this utility. Currently, it works only
on UNIX platform, but should be ported easily to Win32.

ps2img works like "tar" command. For any help, type "ps2img --help"
